# Yolov8 Multitask Seg Det Internship 2024

## Description
This project focuses on optimizing safety and operations in the `railway` environment by developing a `multi-task` model.</br>
The model leverages the `YOLOv8` architecture, combining object detection and semantic segmentation to identify potential obstacles, track tracks, and analyze track-specific data.</br>
This project addresses unique challenges in the rail sector by adapting solutions from autonomous vehicles.</br>
The model is trained and evaluated to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
